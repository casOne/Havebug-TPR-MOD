# Havebug-TPR-MOD
A mod to equip the Thrustmaster TPR rudder with FFB by VPForce

# Objective:
Integrate FFB functionality into the TPR pedal set without affecting its default operation, ensuring reversibility for standard use if needed

# 3D Part:
The mod is built around a 3D-printed adapter that attaches to the horizontal bar on the back side of the rudder pedals

# Preparation
Before installing the part, the rudder pedals must be prepared by performing the following steps:

  1. Rotate the USB connector by 180 degrees (by unscrewing the front plate and rotating the internal PCB).
This allows access to the USB port and enables use of the rudder's basic functions â€” especially the brakes.

  2. Drill holes in the horizontal bar to attach the printed part.
It is recommended to use the adapter as a template for drilling the holes, and then tap them with an M8 thread.
