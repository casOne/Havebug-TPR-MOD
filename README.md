# Havebug-TPR-MOD
A mod to equip the Thrustmaster TPR rudder with FFB by VPForce

# Objective:
Integrate FFB functionality into the TPR pedal set without affecting its default operation, ensuring reversibility for standard use if needed

# 3D Part:
The mod is built around a 3D-printed adapter that attaches to the horizontal bar on the back side of the rudder pedals

# Preparation
Before installing the part, the rudder pedals must be prepared by performing the following steps:

  1. Rotate the USB connector by 180 degrees (by unscrewing the front plate and rotating the internal PCB).
This allows access to the USB port and enables use of the rudder's basic functions — especially the brakes.

  2. Drill holes in the horizontal bar to attach the printed part.
It is recommended to use the adapter as a template for drilling the holes, and then tap them with an M8 thread.

  3. Mount the motor on top of the rudder using a dedicated bracket.
To align it with the rear wall, I added washers to the rear-most mounting points as spacers.

 4. Install a 2020 aluminum profile rail to guide pins fitted with ball bearings.

# Installation notes

- With the current dimensions, the maximum belt width is 15 mm.

- The adapter has a large diameter and features aabout a 10:1 reduction ratio.
As a result, the motor’s sensor will rotate over a wide range, so it’s important to align the sensor to zero before performing calibration.

- Use the pins with ball bearings to align the belt as shown in the figure.
This step is very important because it allows you to:

  1. Ensure proper belt tension. When pressing with a finger, the belt should deflect by approximately 3-4 mm.

  2. Maintain good grip on the motor-side pulley teeth: to prevent the belt from slipping and losing calibration under heavy loads due to poor grip

  3. Ensure consistent belt length throughout the entire pedal travel.
